Challenge 06 - Weather Forecast App README
For this assignment, I created a weather forecasting application that allows the user to search for a city to forecast the weather at given location. Search results are saved in local storage and populated under the search box/button. Moment.js is used to get the current day and time, as well as the OpenWeather API we were given (https://openweathermap.org/) to get the current weather and 5 day forecast.
